# Bash Scripts
A collection of my bash scripts. Some are probably broken, or useful only to me. Some are called directly, others are things that're included in my .bashrc.

Some of these have been collected over the years, and should be attributed as necessary. If you spot somewhere that's not the case, please let me know.

Comments/improvements welcome.
